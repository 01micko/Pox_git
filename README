Pox_git (PuppylinuxOlpcXo_git) a collection of scripts and files needed to 
build Pouppy linux for the OLPC XO-1 and XO-1.5 laptops, starting from a 
puppy ISO image.

There are 3 scripts, to build the kernel, the required SFS files and to 
modify the original SFS and repackage whole thing, and a master script 
("make_build") that calls the other 3. 
The scripts can run also independent of each other, to make a kernel 
for example, or repackage a build.

The files in XO/XO_sfs folder are either modified puppy scripts or new ones 
appropriate for OLPC's XOs. 

The build scripts can run in any linux distro to build an XO-puppy, however 
is highly suggested to use either the puppy version you want to build for 
the XOs or a binary-compatible distro as building environment. On another 
distro you may need to run as root to mount the sfs or run mksquashfs.

We welcome patches and addition, either in the scripts or the XO/XO_sfs/* 
files.
